Welcome to this porject. 

This is the second version of the Qira'at app that we are currently working on and this on we are using Whisper model by OpenAI. 

Same as previously, all libraries are listed on the top of the code make sure to install them to be able to run the code.

For the data set, it's quite large and can't upload it to GitHub. I'll try to find a way to upload it here. For the timebeing you can search some dataset on internet. 

Enjoy!
